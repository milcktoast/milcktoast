# Hello! I'm Ash,

I work as a _creative technologist, creative coder, & 3D generalist_.  
I primarily work with _web technologies_.  
_Los Angeles_ is where I call home.  

[Send me an email][email-url] if you're interested in working together;  
I'm currently looking for a full-time position and am open to freelance / contract work.  

A concise list of [selected works][portfolio-url] is browsable here on Github (with more to come soon).  
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/milcktoast/), [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/jpweeks), and here on GitHub are a few places I put interesting things;  
I'm also open to connecting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milcktoast/).  

In the meantime, [go ahead and play with those tentacle-y things](https://milcktoast.com),  
and I wish you a wonderful day!
